Developer's guide
=================

.. note::

    This guide assumes you have cloned and built the geojs repository
    according to the :ref:`Quick start guide <project-setup-guide>`.

The selenium testing infrastructure of Geojs is run via CTest, it assumes
that the testing "server" is started prior to execution.  To start the
server, just run ::

    grunt default serve-test

This will start a server on the default port of ``30100``.  The port
and selenium host names are configurable with cmake.  For example inside
the Kitware firewall, you can run the following to test on the selenium
node on ``garant`` ::

    cmake -DSELENIUM_TESTS=ON -DSELENIUM_HOST=garant /path/to/geojs
    make
    ctest -VV

You may need to also set the variable ``TESTING_HOST`` to your computer's
IP address reachable by the selenium node.

.. note::

    Typically, CMake is used to build outside of the source tree.  This
    means you would create a new directory somewhare and point cmake
    to the geojs source directory.  You may need to rerun ``cmake``, ``make``,
    and ``grunt`` after making changes to your code for everything to
    build correctly.  Try running ``ccmake /path/to/geojs`` for a full
    list of configuration options.

Geojs employs several different frameworks for unit testing.  These
frameworks have been designed to make it easy for developers to
add more tests as new features are added to the api.

Code quality tests
------------------

All javascript source files included in the library for deployment are
checked against `ESLint <http://eslint.org/>`_ for uniform styling
and strict for common errors patterns.  The style rules for geojs are
located in the ``.eslintrc`` file in the root of the repository.  These
tests are preformed automatically for every file added to the build; no
additional configuration is required.  You can run a quick check of the
code style outside of CMake by running ``npm run lint``.

Headless browser testing
------------------------

Geojs uses `PhantomJS <http://phantomjs.org/>`_ for headless browser
testing of core utilities.  Unfortunately because PhantomJS does not
support webgl at this time, so code paths requiring gl must be either
mocked or run via selenium.

The headless unit tests should be placed in the ``tests/cases/``
directory.  All javascript files in this directory will be detected
by the `Karma <http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html>`_ test
runner and executed automatically when you run ``npm run test``.  It
is possible to debug these tests in a normal browser as well.  Just run
``npm run start`` and browse to `<http://localhost:9876/debug.html>`_.  The
test runner will automatically rebuild the tests as you modify files
so there is no need to rerun this command unless you add a new file.

There are a number of utilities present in the file ``tests/test-utils.js``
that developers can use to make better unit tests.  For example, a mocked
vgl renderer can be used to hit code paths within gl rendered layers.  There
are also methods for mocking global methods like ``requestAnimationFrame``
to test complex, asynchronous code paths in a stable and repeatable manner.
The `Sinon <http://sinonjs.org/>`_ testing library is also available to
generate stubs, spies, and mocked methods.  Because all tests share
a global scope, they should be careful to clean up all mocking and
instrumentation after running.  Ideally, each test should be runnable
independently and use jasmines ``beforeEach`` and ``afterEach`` methods
for setup and tear down.

Selenium testing
----------------

Most tests for geojs require a full browser with webgl support.
For these test, a framework based on `Selenium <http://docs.seleniumhq.org/>`_
is provided.  This test framework is intentionally lightweight to allow
for many different kinds of testing from simple Jasmine style unit tests
to complicated mouse interactions with screenshot comparisons.

All selenium based tests should be placed inside subdirectories of
``testing/test-cases/selenium-tests``.  All subdirectories are assumed
to be selenium tests by CMake and will be instrumented and run accordingly.
Each subdirectory should, at a minimum, contain the following three files,
which may be empty:

1.  ``include.css``: CSS that will be concatenated into a ``style`` node
    in the ``head``.

2.  ``include.html``: HTML that will be concatenated into the ``body``.

3.  ``include.js``: Javascript source that will be concatenated into a ``script``
    node in the ``head`` after the inclusion of the geojs source and all dependent
    libraries.

Generally, developers are free to put arbitrary content into these files; however,
one convention **must** be followed for the default instrumentation to work correctly.
The javascript source should be wrapped in a global function called ``startTest``.
This function will be called automatically by the testing framework after all of
the instrumentation is in place and the page is loaded.  The ``startTest`` function will
be called with function as an argument that should be called when page is ready to
run the unit tests.  This is provided as a convenience for the default behavior
of :py:func:`selenium_test.BaseTest.wait` with no arguments.  Developers can
extend this behavior as necessary to provide more complicated use cases.  As an
example, see the ``d3Animation`` test case which sets a custom variable in a callback
script for a test that is run asynchronously.

The compiled version of these
tests are placed inside the deployment root so the users can manually see the test
results.  The path to each test is derived from the relative path inside
``testing/test-cases/selenium-tests/``.  For example, the test page in
``testing/test-cases/selenium-tests/osmLayer/`` is available at
`<http://localhost:30100/test/selenium/osmLayer/>`_ after starting the test web server.

The unit tests themselves are derived from Python's
`unittest <https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html>`_ module via a customized
subclass :py:class:`selenium_test.BaseTest`.  Detailed documentation of the methods
this class provides is given in the next section.  Developers should feel free to
extend this class with any generally useful methods as they become necessary for
a wider variety test cases.

Example unit test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is a minimal example of a selenium unit test using the testing framework.
More complicated examples can be found by examining the existing tests present
in the source.

``hello/index.html``:

.. code-block:: html

    <div id="div-node"></div>

``hello/index.css``:

.. code-block:: css

    #div-node {
        text-align: center;
    }

``hello/index.js``:

.. code-block:: js

    window.startTest = function (done) {
        $("#div-node").text("Hello, World!");
        done();
    };

``hello/testHelloWorld.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    # Importing setupModule and tearDownModule will start up and
    # shut down the web server automatically.
    from selenium_test import FirefoxTest, setupModule, tearDownModule

    # This test will run on firefox only.
    class HelloWorld(FirefoxTest):
        testCase = ('hello', 'world')

        def test_main(self):
            # Resize the window to have consistent results.
            self.resizeWindow(640, 480)

            # Load the main html for this test directory.
            self.loadUrl('hello/index.html')

            # Wait for it to be loaded.
            self.wait()

            # Now we are ready to test the page.
            # The base class provide easy methods to test a screen shot.
            # This will take a screen shot and compare it against any
            # screenshots in the test image store at revision number 1.
            # Any failure here will raise an exception that will mark the
            # test as failed.
            self.screenshotTest('helloWorldScreenshot', revision=1)

Uploading screenshots to the image store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A script is provided in the source to help developers upload
images to the data store in a way that they can be loaded automatically
by the testing infrastructure.  The script is built into ``test/upload_test_cases.py``
when selenium testing is enabled in CMake.  When creating a new test
(or updating a revision), the following is the recommended method for uploading
test data for the example test ``hello/`` described above. ::

    # inside the build directory
    python test/upload_test_cases.py ../testing/test-cases/selenium-tests/hello

The script will run all the tests in this directory and prompt you if you want to upload a new image
in the event that a screenshot test has failed.  If you intend to start a new
revision, then the revision number should be changed in the unit test source
before running this script.  Note: you must have write permission in the MIDAS
GeoJS community before you can upload new images.  Contact a community administrator
for an invitation.

Code coverage
-------------

Code coverage information is generated automatically for all headless unit tests
by Karma's test runner when running ``npm run test``.  The coverage information is
submitted to `codecov <https://codecov.io/github/OpenGeoscience/geojs>`_ and
`cdash <http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=geojs>`_ after every
successful Travis run.
